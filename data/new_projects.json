Most of those who supported Cone Head's appearance were doing so as part of an unspoken hidden joke surrounding the item (incidentally, Isaac's glasses were added as a secondary component of the aforementioned joke, but were not removed due to their presence in the original game)  The black void surrounding The Halo and the missing pixel on top of Isaac's forehead are the only traces left of Cone Head's addition.",

The last additions to the artwork was. a portrait of Shawn During its lifespan the plaque generated quite a bit of controversy as the discord-based group tried to expand, eventually waging war with r/slovakia and r/stevenuniverse. The plaque stood for quite a long period of time until it was consumed hours before the end of r/place by the mob of r/norge. r/norge felt that the ShawnHate plaque was overreaching, and decided to try and completely erase it, after the group had already reached an alliance with r/slovakia and r/stevenuniverse. Even though ShawnHate attempted to diplomatically resolve the situation, even being aided by the slovaks and r/stevenuniverse, r/norge would not listen. The ShawnHate plaque met its end hours before the end of r/place, and the orange and black pixels in the bottom left are the only remains. \nYou can see what the plaque looked like in its prime: http://i.imgur.com/4U4EKit.png (P.S.
